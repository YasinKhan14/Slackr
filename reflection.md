# Reflection

Iteration 1 has been a resounding success for our team. We have successfully 
completed the writing of test functions and assumptions as required for the
specifications. Our organisational abilities have demonstrated we could complete
this tasking efficiently in the time given.

## Planning
We began, as a group two days, after the specification was released, when all 
four of use met up at the tutorial. As all of us knew each other previously, we
could quickly the strength and weaknesses for our group and each other. We 
decided unanimously to start planning later that night, starting with a group
call. From here, we split up the tasks evenly, as well as tasking additional
specifications to group members which had more time and knew more about the 
task. An example of this is Yasin, who took it upon himself to take initiative
and lead the group in planning, thus being the perfect candidate for writing the
plan.

## Execution
After the designation of work, many of us started on our activities on the 
following day. The writing of test functions proved to be **our hardest challenge**
to overcome as it was the first time any of use had written tests before writing
the program. As such, we talked and communicated through the group chat to 
uniformly decide not only on the format and structure, but getting to terms with
pytest and exceptions. 

We also had difficulty syncronising our work and code across the unfamilar
platform of gitlab. We avoided this by using the web-interface and avoiding the
terminal as necessary.

Although the task was due on Sunday at 8pm, we collectivly agreed to move our
due date forward to friday, in orded to create time and prevent procrastination.
**This was the key to our organisation and effeciency** in completing our set work

From Wednesday to Friday, we spent writing tests for our 8 functions. In our 
group call, we spent 3 hours peer reviewing and sorting through each other's 
code in order to providede suggestions and improvements for our functions. After 
our night meeting onf Friday, we realised the work had been split unevenly as 
the functions tasked to some of our members, required more work than others. We 
also faced difficulties regarding the interpretation and clarity of the 
specification provided, thus resorting to piazza to remedy questions.

Thankfully, due to our premature due date, we could spend Saturday and Sunday,
cleaning up and improving our code based on our peer feedback. We also had 
difficulty syncronising our work and code across the unfamilar platform of 
gitlab. We avoided this by using the web-interface and avoiding the terminal as 
necessary.

## Summary
### What we did well
All of us can agree that our choice to move the due date forward as well as our
constant communication, was our saving grace regarding the completion of our
tasks. It ensured we could stay as efficient and synchronised as possible,
resulting in our consistently best result.

### What we did poorly
Our underestimation of the work ahead and unfamiliarity with the test-first
approach was the biggest problem we faced as a group. Although we moved the due
date forward, many of us expected to finish a lot earlier than our due date.
However, our unfamiliarity with python and pytest, as well as a project on this
size with a brand new approach, corroborated with time wasted and spent finding
solutions and answers to unforseen questions.

### Improvements
Overall, in order to tackle the next iteration, **we unitedly concor to retain our focus on organisation** 
as the most effective solution to unforseen challenges. From iteration 1,
we comprehend the importance of underestimation, and its catastrophic effects on
time management and expectation. As such, with our focus on organisation, we plan to familiarise ourselves with
the functions that we need to produce. By organising and using a top-down 
approach, we can split the functions down to understandable pieces, thus revealing
any possible problems and appoint the reccomended ammount of time to solve.
