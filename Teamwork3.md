> ## Reflection

## Introduction

The Master Branch team has successfully completed Iteration 3, fulfilling all major objectives and outstanding tasks to an exemplary benchmark. Further yet, this iteration marks the end of COMP1531's group project, to which we present our solution. Although not unique, it was developed to a standard that the team proudly supports and has worked together for many weeks to assemble and display.

## Communication
*Communication permits a common vision to transcend expectations and become reality*

The team has maintained a high level of team integration through sustained communication in group meetings and asynchronous stand-ups. Formal meetings involved a multi-hour voice chat on the Discord platform, unanimously scheduled once a week. In these sessions members reported on their progression of the current agenda, discussed any challenges or important issues that require attention, evaluate and reflect on peer work and finally progress onto the next set of goals. 

The established frequency of meetings allowed meaningful progression while also providing a healthy balance for individual commitments. Successful meetings were catalysed by effective preparation and planning of objectives to be discussed before the call session itself. This magnified the overall productivity of the group call and allowed the team to strategically plan the work ahead in time.

## Agile methods of Teamwork
*Because nothing is accomplished alone*.

Agile is a tried-and-tested methodology, that was inherited through adopting an iterative framework of planning, building,testing and reviewing. This core principle was threaded throughout the team's development in the form of sprints which formed the structural backbone of our project goals. Having this systematic procedure allowed group members to reflect and evaluate on each others code. Such a process of multiple members simultaneously working on the same section of code was also exercised through pair programming. Pair programming served as an effective practice when members were facing difficulty properly integrating a function to the front-end. Not only was it efficient in capturing logical flaws within algorithms, it also encouraged immediate feedback and improvement on coding style.

Overall, reflecting back on our growth as a group, we are all proud of how our teamwork skills have developed. This project has simulated the behaviour of working in a group environment, exposing us to new challenges and in turn underpinning the notion of communication and team collaboration being paramount to delivering a successful software product.


## Contingency Plans
*Conceptual preparation for when the back-up plan fails*

Any good team respects the need for emergency arrangements, our team was no different. Due to its resounding effectiveness in previous iterations, we immediately and collectively decided to bring forward the due date of our iteration, to put positive stress on the importance, and to again, permit time and resources for any unforeseen and unresolved inquiry.
This scheme was utilised by the team, due to our unaccustomed outlook on the demanding functions, for example, the stand ups and profile picture requirements, the completion rate was longer than expected, and pushed the team up until the arbitrary due date.
Furthermore, a new challenge arose in the form of message-reacts, which required a intensive team-analysis and full-overhaul, which could be accomplished due to the surplus time of the team.

During the process of refactoring our code, a big note was made to continuously check the success of our pytests, as well as the smooth connection of our backend to the frontend. This was to ensure that while moving code around, we would not accidentally 'break' anything. Overall, this process was done without many complications as we stuck to this rule and ensured everything was working as intended.

## Member Coordination
*Teamwork IS defined as the mutual respect of one other*

Member Coordination requires stubborn dedication to follow, yet its benefits are fruitfully rewarding. Coordination is entangled with communication, thus our team, which naturally promoted communication, had little problems with coordination. Trust and faith in each other, to fulfill required tasks and support one another when needed, ensured no major issues occurred domestically, between members.

The large project required multiple members to work on the same code simultaneously, to satisfy time constraints. As such, our team communicated constantly to prevent stepping on each others toes and prevent the deletion or disregard of each others labors.

Standardisation of code quality was a primary focus. Presented with changing specifications, each member had a unique perception on the execution of certain functions. Thus, constant meetings ensured a homogenised viewpoint and execution. Furthermore, the creation of helper functions secured a minimalist and consistent format within the code.

## Summary

This iteration concludes the group project of COMP1531. Our team performance has surpassed all or our individual expectations, a truthful reminder to the capability teamwork bears. Yet, further emphasised is the exclusive learning experience that such a project offers, a priceless experience that oversteps the boundaries of software development into the real world.
