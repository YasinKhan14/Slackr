Reflection

The master branch team has maintained a high level of team integration through sustained communication in group meetings and asynchronous stand-ups. Formal meetings involved a 1-2 hour discord call scheduled once a week. In these sessions members reported on their progression of the current agenda, discussed any challenges or important issues that require attention, evaluate and reflect on peer work and finally progress onto the next set of goals. 

The established frequency of meetings allowed meaningful progression while also providing a healthy balance for individual commitments. Successful meetings were catalysed by effective preparation and planning of objectives to be discussed before the call session itself. This enhanced the overall productivity of the group call and allowed us to strategically plan our work ahead in time.

The agile methodology was inherited through adopting an iterative framework of planning, building and testing/reviewing. This core principle was threaded throughout our development in the form of sprints which formed the structural backbone of our project goals. Having this systematic procedure allowed group members to reflect and evaluate on each others code. Such a  process of multiple members simultaneously working on the same section of code was also exercised through pair programming. Pair programming served as an effective practice when members were facing difficulty properly integrating a function to the front-end. Not only was it efficient in capturing logical flaws within algorithms, it also encouraged immediate feedback and improvement on coding style.

Overall, reflecting back on our growth as a group, we are all proud of how our teamwork skills have developed. This project has simulated the behaviour of working in a group environment, exposing us to new challenges and in turn underpinning the notion of communication and team collaboration being paramount to delivering a successful software product.

**Need to add stuff on things that did not go according to plan. Should be able to think of ideas during the next group meeting.
