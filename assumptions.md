Add assumptions below:
All test assume that nothing (users/channels/reacts/messages) exist prior to testing
All test assume that user1 is a normal user and admin1 and admin2 are admins and owner1 is an owner of the channel
All test in message send assume literal strings e.g. '1000characterstring' is a 1000 character string
